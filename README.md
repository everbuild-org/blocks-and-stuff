This library provides a set of common implementations for blocks and fluids tailored for the Minestom framework. Its
purpose is to simplify and standardize the management of these entities in Minestom projects. By using this
library, developers can save time and focus on the unique aspects of their projects while relying on tested and reusable
components for core world functionalities.

### Key Features:

- **Blocks & Fluids**: Easy-to-use APIs for enabling block placement and block handlers as well as fluid simulation for
  both custom and default blocks and fluids
- **Efficiency**: Optimized solutions built to integrate seamlessly with the Minestom framework.
- **Flexibility**: Highly customizable implementations suitable for a variety of use cases.

# Installation & Usage

> This library is not yet considered stable

The latest version is always published to our maven repository at [mvn.everbuild.org](https://mvn.everbuild.org/#/public/org/everbuild/blocksandstuff). On the page of the maven repo. you can easily check the latest version and inclusion information.

# Versioning

We're using Semantic Versioning for this project, although before the first `1.0.0`-release, we'll update API as we
see fit. In any other scenario, the versioning will follow these principles:

- **MAJOR version**: Incremented for incompatible API changes.
- **MINOR version**: Incremented for new features introduced in a backward-compatible manner.
- **PATCH version**: Incremented for backward-compatible bug fixes.
  For versions prior to `1.0.0`, the rules above are considered more flexible. Breaking changes may be introduced in
  minor versions, so it is important to keep this in mind when using pre-production versions of the library.
